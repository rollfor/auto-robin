-- Hands selected items out in a strict, visible rotation instead of rolling for them. When a loot
-- window opens with an item on the round-robin list in it, the item's category names a queue, the
-- first player in that queue who can actually receive gets it, and they go to the back.
--
-- One queue per category (Gems, Marks, Hearts -- see AutoRoundRobinDb), each independent: taking
-- a gem does not move you down the Marks queue.
--
-- A queue is an ordered list of { name, class, core } and nothing else. There is no random draw,
-- no cycle counter and no derived standing: the order you see is the order it serves, which is
-- the point of showing it. It is seeded from the group roster, joiners are appended, and from
-- there it is yours to edit -- add, remove, move a player, or rotate the whole thing.
--
-- `core` is the one flag a player carries, and it answers exactly one question: do they survive
-- the next group. Somebody added by hand is core, somebody the roster swept in is not, and the
-- checkbox on their row moves them between the two. Everything else -- their place, their turn,
-- whether they can be paid -- is blind to it. Written on every insert rather than left absent on
-- the ones that aren't core, so a queue never has to guess what a missing flag meant.
--
-- The one thing the order alone does not decide is who can actually be handed the item.
-- GetMasterLootCandidate is the authority on that -- players outside the instance, offline or out
-- of range are simply not listed -- so the award walks down the queue to the first player who is
-- listed. Whoever it walks past keeps their place and wins the next drop they are around for.
-- That is the whole reason the queue and the candidate list are kept apart.
--
-- Kept apart in the read direction too: nothing this module hands out says whether a player can
-- receive. That is only answerable while a loot window is open, so a queue carrying it around
-- would be asserting something it cannot know for all but a few seconds at a time.
