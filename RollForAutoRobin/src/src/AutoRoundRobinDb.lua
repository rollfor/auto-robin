-- The round-robin catalogue: which items /rf autorobin is allowed to hand out, grouped into
-- categories. Deliberately narrow. Round robin awards loot on its own, so what belongs here is
-- the bulk-consumable end of the drop table that nobody wants to burn a roll on.
--
-- Two levels, Category -> items, where auto-loot's is three (Dungeon -> Boss -> items). Which
-- raid a gem fell out of is not a fact this feature has any use for -- one gem is one gem, and
-- one queue serves all of them -- so the raid level is not modelled at all. That is also why the
-- seeding and query functions below are here rather than shared with AutoLootDb through
-- AutoLootDb: the two catalogues no longer have the same shape. Building an item link is the
-- only thing they still do the same way, and that is ItemUtils'.
--
-- The categories are the unit of rotation: each one owns an independent queue (see
-- AutoRoundRobin), so adding a category here adds a queue with no other change. Trash Ignored is
-- the one exception, and M.categories leaving it out is the whole of how it has no queue.
--
-- The ids and icons are the ones already verified in AutoLootDb (Black Temple Trash), not
-- re-derived, so nothing here needs a live GetItemInfo fetch.

-- Trash and Trash Ignored (below) are the two that aren't ordinary lists of ids to hand out --
-- see the comments on them.
